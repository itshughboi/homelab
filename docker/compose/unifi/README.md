Good security measure will be to put firewall restrictions to my dns server to specific subnets. Super low risk in my environment, but good to be in practice of restricting internal dns servers to authorized subnets




## Unifi
- Management network needs DHCP option to point to netbootxyz machine to load iPXE
    - see for more info: iac\bootstrap\README.md   
- Each Proxmox node will need 3 virtual interfaces. `pve-srv-1` should have **2**+ physical NICs.
	1. Management / Cluster VLAN
	2. Storage VLAN - MTU 9000
- Apply QoS to **VLAN 20** with QoS to prioritize Corosync traffic.
- Allow Jumbo Frames on **VLAN 40** << 6x more data per packet. Maaximizes throughput + Minimizes overhead 

> [!DANGER] Jumbo Frames
> Every device on VLAN 40 (Proxmox, Truenas, PBS) MUST support and be configure for **MTU 9000** or else packets will drop. Jumbo packets can't go over the internet which is why we created this VLAN specifically for internal storage

| Virtual Interface | Target VLAN | Gateway      | MTU  |DHCP 67
| :---------------- | :---------- | ------------ | ---- |-----------
| **vmbr0.10**      | 10          | 10.10.10.254 | 1500 |10.10.99.99
| **vmbr0.20**      | 20          | None         | 1500 |
| **vmbr0.40**      | 40          | None         | 9000 |

- Create the following networks in Unifi << CAN BE DONE WITH ANSIBLE

| Name         | VLAN ID | CIDR           | Notes                  |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Management   | 1       | 10.10.10.0/24  | SSH, Web UI, Unifi, Bind9
| Cluster      | 2       | 10.10.20.0/24  | Corosync               | 
| k3s          | 3       | 10.10.30.0/24  |                        |   
| Storage      | 4       | 10.10.40.0/24  | TrueNAS, PBS, Longhorn |
| VPN          | 8       | 10.10.80.0/24  | Tailscale              |
| Torrent      | 49      | 172.16.49.0/24 |                        |
| Provisioning | 99      | 10.10.99.0/24  | Netboot                |


### Additional Notes:

**VLAN 20**: Corosync is very sensitive to latency. If I'm flooding a NIC with backups or storage retrieval, it can cause jitter and fuck with Proxmox and may cause a Fencing (Hard Reboot) event. Problem is that I enjoy seeing the webUI at 10.10.10.x/24. This has **NO GATEWAY**. Only internal routing.<br>

**VLAN 40**:  Similar to VLAN 20, PBS or Longhorn can saturate the management NIC which can slow down SSH or Athena VM. This has **NO GATEWAY**. Only internal routing. **Jumbo Frames** enabled
