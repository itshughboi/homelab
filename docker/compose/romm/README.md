## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Edit .env files
3. Stand up docker compose
4. Start uploading + playing

## Directory strucutre
- Romm itself will create the proper folder structure once you pull it. When you upload in the UI and pick the 'GBA' type e.g. it will automatically create the correct GBA directory. So I shouldn't have to create any files or directories outside of the docker-compose.yaml and the .env file
