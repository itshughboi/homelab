### iOS Client
When connecting iOS calendar to this, you will need to go to Mail -> New Account -> CalDav. Then put in server details. It will fail the first time. Once **Advanced Settings** shows, change the address
to be the following: http://your.baikal.url/dav.php/principals/USERNAME/ e.g. http://baikal.hughboi.cc/dav/php/principals/hughboi/
